### Initializing experiment

The [Tergite SDK](https://github.com/tergite/tergite) sends a request to the 
[Tergite public API](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend/tree/main/apps/tergite-mss) to initialize
the experiment for a given backend.

The public API creates an empty job with a unique ID and saves it in ites database.
It responds to the SDK with the job ID and the URL of the backend.

### Updating experiment results

The [Tergite SDK](https://github.com/tergite/tergite) sends the OpenPulse representation of the
experiment(s) to the [Tergite backend](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend).
The Tergite backend runs the experiments and sends the results to the
[Tergite public API](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend/tree/main/apps/tergite-mss) app.

The public API app updates the job in the database with the status of the run and the results, if any,
of the experiment(s).

### Retrieving experiment results

The [Tergite SDK](https://github.com/tergite/tergite) then requests the 
[Tergite public API](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend/tree/main/apps/tergite-mss)
for the results. The public API then reads the results from its database and responds to the SDK with them.
