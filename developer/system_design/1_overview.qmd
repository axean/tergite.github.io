## Structure

![](../../assets/img/index/tergite-overview.svg){width=100%}


### Components

The tergite stack is composed of three components

[backend](./2_backend.qmd)
: The operating system of the quantum computer. It communicates with the world via a RESTful API.  

[frontend](./4_dashboard.qmd)
: The user facing part of the system comprising:

    - [dashboard](./4_dashboard.qmd)  
    : The web-based user interface to take a peek into the quantum computer's properties  

    - [Public API](./3_public_api.qmd)  
    : The RESTful API to take a peek into the quantum computer's properties  

[SDK](./5_sdk.qmd)
: The Python software development kit (SDK) quantum computer researchers can use in their scripts to interact with the tergite stack.


### Accessories

The tergite stack has a number of accessory softwares that are currently not initmately woven into the
stack but mught be in future

[automatic calibration](./6_automatic_calibration.qmd)
: The Python commandline application (CLI) that is used to automatically tune the quantum computer.
