title: "Why tergite?"
---

Tergite was built to enable multiple users across the world interface with a single
computer in one corner of the world. This was because it was not practical for 
private individuals to purchase and operate their own quantum computers. At least not
at the present time.

It is impractical for private individuals to own and operate their own quantum
computers because of the following reasons:

### Quantum Computers are too big to be personal

The superconducting quantum computers built under the WACQT program are very big.
They typically occupy space of 3 square metres and more.

### Quantum Computers are too complex to be personal

The WACQT quantum computer is a complex machine. It requires temperatures of -273<sup>o</sup>C 
for superconductivity to kick in. Superconductivity is where electrical conductors offer zero
resistance to the flow of electricity. The quantum mechanics of the system are observable and 
controllable when superconductivity has kicked in.  

Such temperatures can only be achieved with huge fridges that require complex setups of compressors
and other equipment that require professional setup and operation.  

Apart from the required temperatures, the quantum computer is controlled by use of radio frequency (RF)
pulses generated by specialized RF equipment. Setting these up as well as operating them requires
a skillset that is only possessed by a few people, after years of training.  


### Quantum Computers are too expensive to be personal

Since the quantum computer requires a number of expensive equipment as well as specialist labour,
it is quite expensive to purchase and operate. Even small companies cannot afford it.
