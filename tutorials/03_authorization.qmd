title: "Authorization"
---

This is how the Main Service Server (MSS) in [tergite-frontend](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend) 
controls the user access to the quantum computer resource.

- We control access to MSS, and its tergite-backend instances using two ways
  - `roles` control basic access to auth-related endpoints e.g. project creation, token management etc.
  - `projects` control access to all other endpoints. To create a job, or get its results etc,
    one must be attached to a project that has more than zero QPU seconds.
- QPU seconds are the number of seconds a project's experiments are allocated on the quantum computer.
- QPU seconds can be increased, decreased etc., but no job can be created without positive QPU seconds.
- A job could run for longer than the allocated project QPU seconds but
  it may fail to update MSS of its results. A user must thus make sure their project has enough QPU seconds.

### How Authorization Works

Here is an interaction diagram of auth showcasing authentication via [MyAccessID](https://ds.myaccessid.org/).
