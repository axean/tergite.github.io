title: "Resource Management with Puhuri"
---

[Puhuri](https://puhuri.neic.no/) is an HPC resource management platform that could also be used to manage Quantumm Computer systems.

We need to synchronize MSS's resource management with that in Puhuri

## Flows

More information about flows can be found in the [puhuri tergite flows tutorial](./06_puhuri_tergite_flows.qmd)

## Assumptions

- When creating components in the puhuri UI, the 'measurement unit's
  set on the component are of the following possible values:
  'second', 'hour', 'minute', 'day', 'week', 'half_month', and 'month'.

## How to Start the Puhuri Sync

- Ensure that the `is_enabled = true` in the `[puhuri]` table in your `mss-config.toml` file
- Ensure all other variables in the `[puhuri]` table in your `mss-config.toml` file are appropriately set e.g.

```toml
[puhuri]
# the URI to the Puhuri WALDUR server instance
# Please contact the Puhuri team to get this.
waldur_api_uri = "<the URI to the Puhuri Waldur server>"
# The access token to be used in the Waldur client [https://docs.waldur.com/user-guide/] to connect to Puhuri
# Please contact the Puhuri team on how to get this from the UI
waldur_client_token = "<API token for a puhuri user who has 'service provider manager' role for our offering on puhuri>"
# The unique ID for the service provider associated with this app in the Waldur Puhuri server
# Please contact the Puhuri team on how to get this from the UI
provider_uuid = "<the unique ID for the service provider associated with this app in Puhuri>"
# the interval in seconds at which puhuri is polled. default is 900 (15 minutes)
poll_interval = "<some value>"
```

- If you wish to start only the puhuri synchronization script without the REST API, run in your virtual environment:

```zsh
python -m api.scripts.puhuri_sync --ignore-if-disabled
```

- In order to run both the REST API and this puhuri synchronization script, run in your virtual environment:

```zsh
python -m api.scripts.puhuri_sync --ignore-if-disabled & \
  uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 api.rest:app  --proxy-headers
```
