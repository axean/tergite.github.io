## [2024.04.0] - 2024-05-28

Initial Public Release

### Added

- Added storage_file lib (formerly tergite-quantify-connector-storagefile)
- Added `quantum_executor` service (formerly tergite-quantify-connector)
- Added the `executor-config.yml` and its python-based validators

### Changed

- Changed the way discriminators are loaded to load from the database
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Removed hard-coded discriminators
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Removed official support for Python 3.8; Official support is now >=3.9
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Removed Labber support
- Replaced tergite-quantify-connector-storagefile package with an internal storage_file lib
- Moved unused files to `archive` folder
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Removed calibration and two state discrimination source code
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Replaced tergite-quantify-connector-storagefile package with an internal storage_file lib
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Merged tergite-quantify-connector into tergite-backend and renamed its service to `quantum_executor`
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Changed configuration of hardware to use `executor-config.yml` file with proper validations on loading
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Removed support for `Pulsar`, or any other instrument drivers other than `Cluster`   
  The old implementation wrongfully assumed that all these drivers have the same signature i.e. `driver(name: str, identifier: str | None)`  
  yet `SpiRack(name: str, address: str, baud_rate: int = 9600, timeout: float = 1, is_dummy: bool = False,)`,   
  `Pulsar(name: str, identifier: Optional[str] = None, port: Optional[int] = None, debug: Optional[int] = None, dummy_type: Optional[PulsarType] = None,)`   
  `Cluster(name: str, identifier: Optional[str] = None, port: Optional[int] = None, debug: Optional[int] = None, dummy_type: Optional[PulsarType] = None)` are all different.  
- BREAKING_CHANGE: We got rid of quantify connectorâ€™s redundant reset() method.
- BREAKING_CHANGE: Changed backend name used when querying MSS for backend properties to be equal to `settings.DEFAULT_PREFIX`

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate job uploads to respond with HTTP 409
