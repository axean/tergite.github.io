## Structure

![](./assets/img/tergite-overview.svg){width=100%}
  
    
### Components

The tergite stack is composed of three components

[tergite-backend](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend)
: The operating system of the quantum computer. It communicates with the world via a RESTful API.  

[tergite-frontend](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-frontend)
: The server that gives remote access to any [tergite-backend instance](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend). It communicates with the world via a RESTful API.  

[tergite SDK (or just _tergite_)](https://github.com/tergite/tergite)
: The Python software development kit (SDK) quantum computer researchers can use in their scripts to interact with the tergite stack.


### Accessories

The tergite stack has a number of accessory softwares that are currently not initmately woven into the
stack but mught be in future

[tergite-autocalibration](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-autocalibration)
: The Python commandline application (CLI) that is used to automatically tune the quantum computer.  

### Language of Communication

We use [OpenPulse](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03452) to communicate pass quantum computer instructions from 
the SDK to the backend part of the tergite stack.
